   * (12/14/2006) Fixed memory leak stemming from scale_space_extrema()
   * (01/19/2007) Fixed memory leak in calc_feature_oris()
   * (09/10/2007) Removed unused variables in convert_to_gray32() and
	scale_space_extrema()
   * (11/08/2007) Changed RGB2GRAY flag to BGR2GRAY in convert_to_gray32()
	to conform to OpenCV image storage conventions
