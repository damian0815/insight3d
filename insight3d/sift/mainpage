1. Intro

This is a collection of code I've put together to detect SIFT features 
in images and to use SIFT (or other) features to compute image 
transforms with RANSAC. It includes a SIFT function library as well as 
some executables to detect, match, and display keypoints. For more 
information on SIFT, refer to the paper by Lowe:

Lowe, D. Distinctive image features from scale-invariant keypoints. 
<EM>International Journal of Computer Vision, 60</EM>, 2 (2004), 
pp.91--110.

Or see Lowe's website:<BR>
http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/keypoints/

Some of the code also works with affine-invariant features from the code 
by the VGG at oxford:<BR>
http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk:5000/~vgg/research/affine/index.html

Check out match.c for an example of how to use the RANSAC function.  Try 
`match beaver.png beaver_xform.png` to see it work.

Use the navigation bar at the top of this page to browse the 
documentation.

Help is available for executables using the '-h' command line option.

2. Requirements

All code in this package requires the OpenCV library (known working
version is 1.0.0):<BR>
http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/

Some functions require GDK/GTK+2 (known working version is 2.10.14):<BR>
http://www.gtk.org/

Some functions require the Gnu Scientific Library (GSL) (known working
version is 1.9):<BR>
http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/

3. Building

To build everything, use make:

<pre>
> make
</pre>

This should produce a few executables in bin/, a static library
lib/libfeat.a, and some HTML documentation in docs/.  You can use the -h
argument to get help with any of the executables.  libfeat.a can be
compiled into your own code using the standard method:

<pre>
> gcc -I/path/to/sift/include/ -L/path/to/sift/lib/ yourcode.c -o yourexecutable -lfeat
</pre>

The documentation in docs/ describes all of the functions available in
libfeat.a as well as #defines, etc.  Use the documentation to determine
what header files from include/ to include in your code.

You can also individually build any of the executables or libfeat.a,
e.g.

<pre>
> make libfeat.a
</pre>
